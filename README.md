#  Multi-step form

![Design preview for the Multi-step form coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

**This project has been created using Angular along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

This project is to build out this multi-step form:

The users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made


**Have fun building!** 🚀 **Mohamed Mousa ❤️**
